# Gedit

Gedit, the default GUI editor if you use Gnome, also runs under KDE and
other desktops. Most gNewSense and Ubuntu installations use Gnome by
default. To start Gedit open a terminal and type

    $ gedit &

You should see this:

![gedit](images/IntroCommandLine-Gedit-gedit-en.png "gedit"){width="504"
height="456"}

This looks like most basic editors on any operating system. You can use
Gedit through the GUI, and the commands are simple:

**File-\>Open** : Opens an existing file

**File-\>New** : Creates a new (blank) file

**File-\>Save** : Saves a file

**ctrl + c** : copy

**ctrl + v** : paste\

That\'s all you really need to do. To add text just type!

## Line Numbers

Gedit tracks your cursor and displays the position at the bottom of the
interface:

![gedit_cursor](images/IntroCommandLine-Gedit-gedit_cursor-en.png "gedit_cursor"){width="504"
height="456"}

This can be handy information to know. If you keep track of the line
numbers you can use these to jump quickly around the text file by using
the "Go to Line" feature. This can be accessed via the interface
(**Search -\> Go to Line**) or via the shortcut **ctrl** + **i**.
